If there were more time, these are the things I would have done:
* Included pagination in all list returning API calls.
* Added API validation with Joi
* Refactored the controllers to move some logic to services
* Create unit tests for each functionality. I usually do TDD but I wanted to complete more features so I didnt spend time on unit tests.
* Add more cases/details to the API docs
* Add image upload to an S3 bucket. Currently a link is just saved.
